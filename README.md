## About Triumvir Technologies

Each season, crop farmers find themselves in an unenviable position: they must decide whether to
apply expensive prophylactic fungicides or risk yield losses to disease. The individual decisions they
make will have a profound impact on profitability. On one hand, at a cost of around $23 per acre,
unnecessary application of fungicides can quickly erode the already narrow margin on commodity crops
such as corn. On the other hand, unimpeded spread of virulent diseases can reduce yields by upwards
of 60%.
At a macro level, the economic burden of plant disease is vast: an estimated 13% of global crops are lost
to disease each year. One of the most critical crop diseases in North America is Northern Leaf Blight,
which can cause over a quarter of all plant loss due to disease and can cause losses of over $1.9 billion.
Triumvir Technologies intends to alleviate farmer stress and ameliorate crop loss by commercializing a
crop screening technology developed at Columbia University that can autonomously identify plants in
the field that exhibit symptoms of Northern Leaf Blight with over 96% accuracy. The technology uses a
deep learning algorithm that has been trained to identify the characteristic cigar-shaped lesions of the
disease. Pairing this algorithm with autonomous agricultural drones equipped with cameras can provide
farmers with near-real-time information about potential disease in their fields, allowing the farmers to
take direct action by applying fungicides in a more surgical manner than before. The actionable business
insights generated from this system can both reduce the need for prophylactic fungicide application and
reduce the amount of fungicide necessary if disease is found, both enhancing profitability over current
best practices.
